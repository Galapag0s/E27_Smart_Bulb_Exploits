# E27 Smart Bulb Exploits
Identifiable by the ID P1911011345020000095$RA77172, this bulb was found on amazon at https://www.amazon.com/Changing-Compatible-Equivalent-Controlled-Smartphone/dp/B07H2977C2.  

Upon receiving it, I began performing several basic tests.  During these tests I uncovered several vulnerabilities.

## Scripts
### sniffer.sh
This script will allow an attacker to steal the wifi SSID and password during the intial configuration.  By connecting to the bulbs network and performing a MITM attack, an attacker can steal wifi passwords.
#### Usage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;./sniffer.sh <Light_IP> <Phone_IP> <Network_Interface>

### toggleLight.py
This script will allow an unauthenticated user to turn on and off the bulb.  This attack affects all bulbs on the given LAN.
This behavior has been witnessed in other models and has been turned into a "feature".  Given that the device provides a mechanism to control who can access and affect the device, this "feature" feels like a vulnerability to me.
#### Usage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;python3 toggleLight.py <Light_IP_Address> <--on | --off>
