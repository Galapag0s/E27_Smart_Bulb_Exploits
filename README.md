# E27 Smart Bulb Exploits
Identifiable by the ID P1911011345020000095$RA77172, this bulb was found on amazon at https://www.amazon.com/Changing-Compatible-Equivalent-Controlled-Smartphone/dp/B07H28KVHV/.  

Upon receiving it, I began performing several basic tests.  During these tests I uncovered several vulnerabilities.

## Scripts
### toggleLight.py
This script will allow an unauthenticated user to turn on and off the bulb.  This attack affects all bulbs on the given LAN.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#### Useage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;python3 toggleLight.py <Light_IP_Address> <--on | --off>

### sniffer.sh
This script will allow an attacker to steal the wifi SSID and password during the intial configuration.  By connecting to the bulbs network and performing a MITM attack, an attacker can steal wifi passwords.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#### Useage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;./sniffer.sh <Light_IP> <Phone_IP> <Network_Interface>
